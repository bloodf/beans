 *
 * The cast widens the props by the one prop the loops write. `matrix` is a real

 * absent from `GProps`, which describes what a *consumer* passes to `<G>`:
 * there, `transform` is the prop, and `react-native-svg` turns it into `matrix`
 * in JavaScript on its way down. A worklet skips that JavaScript, so it has to
 * write the lower prop, and saying so here is more honest than an `as never` at

            stop it. So the still lift is passed the way `Blobatar` passes it,
