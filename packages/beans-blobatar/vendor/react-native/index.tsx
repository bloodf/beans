/**
 * `@blobatar/react-native`, the React Native and Expo adapter.
 *
 * ## Why this one holds a component when `@blobatar/react` does not
 *
 * `@blobatar/react` is an alias: the component still lives in `blobatar/react`
 * until v3, because that subpath shipped with consumers and core cannot depend
 * on a package that peer-depends on core (ADR-0009). Nothing analogous is true
 * here. There is no `blobatar/react-native` subpath and there never will be.
 * ADR-0009 freezes core's optional peer list at `react` and `vue`, and the
 * moment a third adapter subpath appears the peer list resumes growing and the
 * reason for splitting is gone. So this package holds the real implementation
 * from its first release, the way Solid and Preact do.
 *
 * ## Why it draws elements rather than parsing a string
 *
 * Neither of the two rendering modes the DOM adapters use survives the port.
 * The static one is an `<img>` carrying a `data:image/svg+xml` URI, and React
 * Native's `<Image>` does not decode SVG. The animated one hands `parts.inner`
 * to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and there is no `innerHTML` here at all.
 *
 * `react-native-svg` ships an `SvgXml` that would parse `blobatar()`'s string
 * at runtime, and that was the obvious shape and the wrong one: it puts an XML
 * parser between the renderer and the screen, which is a place the picture can
 * change, and ADR-0009 is explicit that an adapter adds no geometry of its own.
 * So core grew `_marks`, the same figure as drawing primitives, and this file
 * maps them onto elements. What crosses the boundary is data core produced,
 * not markup something re-interpreted.
 *
 * Every silhouette in gen2 draws with `<path>` and `<circle>` and nothing else:
 * no gradients, no filters, no masks, no `currentColor`. That is what makes the
 * mapping total rather than approximate.
 *
 * ## Why it imports no React Native module at all
 *
 * The only two imports here are `react` and `react-native-svg`, and the morph
 * below keeps it that way on purpose. `react-native`'s own entry point is
 * Flow-typed source that Bun cannot parse, which is why `packages/harness`
 * renders this adapter through a stub, so every runtime import of it is a
 * component this workspace can no longer test. `Animated` and `Easing` would
 * have bought a timing loop and a bezier that are together forty lines, at the
 * cost of the only instrument that checks this adapter draws the same blobatar
 * as every other one. `requestAnimationFrame` is a global on this platform and
 * needs no import, so that is what drives the morph.
 *
 * The one thing that trade genuinely costs is reading the OS reduced-motion
 * setting, which lives on `AccessibilityInfo`. See `morph` below for where
 * that lands instead.

 * stops. `AnimatedBlobatar` is already running one forever, and a second loop
 * beside it would be two `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks per blobatar per
 * frame, setting state twice, to draw one picture.
 *
 * So the clock is the caller's and the bookkeeping is here. That is what keeps
 * the two components from each carrying their own copy of interrupt handling,
 * which is the part with the subtle rule in it.
 *
 * State holds *what is on screen*, not a progress fraction, and that is what
 * makes an interrupted morph correct without a special case. Setting a new
 * expression half way through the last one starts from wherever the face
 * actually is, so poses chained faster than 300ms flow into each other instead
 * of snapping back to a start the consumer never saw.

/**
 * The animated blobatar: the idle layer, and the morph along with it.
 *
 * Six levels of group, which is the same tree `motion.css` decorates, and every
 * level of it earns its place by having a different origin or a different
 * clock.
 *
 * ## Which thread each layer runs on, and why they differ
 *
 * **The loops run on the UI thread.** One `useFrameCallback` writes a clock,
 * one `useDerivedValue` evaluates every loop from it, and each group's
 * transform is a `useAnimatedProps` reading that. No React render happens per
 * frame, which is the entire point: a sidebar of agents all animating at once
 * is the case this is for, and a render per blobatar per frame is what makes
 * that stutter.
 *
 * **The pose runs on the JS thread**, in `useMorph`, and that is deliberate
 * rather than a gap. A morph is a one-shot 300ms transition on a state change
 * the consumer made, not a loop, so it costs about eighteen renders once
 * instead of sixty a second forever. Keeping it here also keeps
 * `poseTransforms` out of a worklet, and that function is the subtlest
 * arithmetic in the library and the one a real browser is used to check. The
 * seesaw reaches it as an extra translate on the outside rather than as a
 * parameter, which composes exactly. See `rockT`.

/**
 * A blobatar that animates the change from one `expression` to the next
 * instead of cutting to it.
 *
 * Identical to `Blobatar` in every other way, including its props, and a
 * separate export rather than a `morph` prop for one measured reason: the
 * morph is about 1.1 kB gz of machinery, and a prop on a single component is
 * reachable from that component whether or not anybody passes it, so every
 * consumer would carry it. Two components means a bundler drops all of it for
 * an app that never names this one. `packages/harness/scripts/size.ts` gates
 * both numbers, and the row for `Blobatar` is what says the still path stayed
 * free.
 *
 * That is the same trade the roster makes by having expressions be values a
 * consumer imports rather than strings a renderer looks up, and the same one
 * `_marks` and `_posed` make in core.
 *
 * Timed and curved to match `motion.css` exactly: 300ms adopting an
 * expression, 400ms returning to idle, because an expression is a message the
 * consumer sent and yanking it off the face reads as a glitch rather than as a
 * creature settling. The morph itself is core's, channel for channel, and
 * `test/morph.test.ts` there holds a frozen frame of it against the static
 * renderer at every pose.
 *
 * **Reduced motion is the caller's to honour**, by rendering `Blobatar`
 * instead, and the header above says why this file cannot read the setting
 * itself. React Native exposes it as
 * `AccessibilityInfo.useReduceMotionEnabled()` in an app that already imports
 * `react-native`, which makes the whole of it one ternary at the call site.
 * Swapping components mid-morph lands on the target pose immediately, which is
 * what the stylesheet's `transition: none` does under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * There is no morph on mount. A blobatar eases out of idle only once a
 * consumer changes its expression, which is the web's rule too: transitions do
 * not run on an element's first style resolution, and a grid of avatars
 * animating themselves into existence on first paint is not what either
 * platform does.

/**
 * A blobatar with its idle layer running: breathe, bob, blink, glance, and the
 * tremor and seesaw two expressions carry. It morphs between expressions too,
 * so it is `MorphingBlobatar` with the ambient motion added rather than an
 * alternative to it.
 *
 * A third export rather than a prop, on the same measured grounds as the
 * second: the idle layer is the largest of the three tiers, and a prop on one
 * component is reachable from it whether or not anybody passes it. Three
 * components means an app pays for the tier it names.
 *
 * ## `animate` is the caller's, and that is the platform's doing
 *
 * On the web the idle layer is gated on `:hover`, which is both the aesthetic
 * answer and the performance one, and `animate="hover"` is the recommended
 * default for a grid. There is no hover on a touch screen. `motion.css` already
 * says so itself, under `@media not ((hover: hover) and (pointer: fine))`,
 * where it pauses every loop and forces amplitude to zero unless the blobatar
 * was marked `always`. So the only mode this platform has is the always one,
 * and the question of *when* becomes the app's rather than the library's.
 *
 * Which is the honest answer rather than a shortcut. Screen focus, list
 * viewability, a user preference, the OS reduced-motion setting: those are all
 * things an app knows and a component drawn into a scroll view does not.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // a profile header, one large avatar
 * <AnimatedBlobatar name="ada" size={120} animate />
 *
 * // a grid: only what the list says is on screen
 * <AnimatedBlobatar name={u.id} size={44} animate={visible.has(u.id)} />
 *
 * // the OS setting, which this package cannot read itself
 * <AnimatedBlobatar name="ada" size={120} animate={!reduceMotion} />
 * ```
 *
 * It defaults to false, so an `AnimatedBlobatar` nobody has told to animate is
 * a still blobatar. Turning it on and off ramps the amplitude over 400ms rather
 * than switching it, which is `.mo-root`'s own transition: a blobatar that
 * begins breathing at full depth mid-breath reads as a fault.
 *
 * ## What runs it
 *
 * A `requestAnimationFrame` loop and a React render per frame, which is the
 * driver the morph already uses. Not Reanimated, and that was a decision with a
 * cost: worklets would run this on the UI thread, but a library has to ship
 * them pre-compiled, which means a Babel pass over a package built with Bun, a
 * peer dependency with a native build, and a copy of the composition inside the
 * worklet, since a worklet cannot call core's `idleTransforms`. That last one
 * is the thing ADR-0009 exists to prevent.
 *
 * The trade it leaves is real and worth knowing: every animating blobatar
 * re-renders sixty times a second on the JS thread. `animate` being the
 * caller's is what makes that affordable, because the app is the only thing
 * that knows how many need to be live at once.
